## Requirements

**- Python 3 (recommend 3.6.2 - latest 3.6 version until now)**
Other python 3 versions should work without problem however I recommend using the  latest 3.6 version
Please note that if you use Python2 for this project, you will get a lot of errors because it has been built in Python3 which is quite different from Python2

**- PostgreSQL 9.6.5**
Should use docker for installing PostgreSQl. It's the easiest way. PostgreSQL officially supports docker at: https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/

**- Django 1.11.5**
The latest Django until now
Be sure your django app starts with Python3. If you run "`./manage runserver`" it will use the default Python (is usually Python2). To make sure it run with Python3, use "`python3 manage runserver`"
